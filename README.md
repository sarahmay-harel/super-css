# super-css

Learning more about CSS! Some awesome things I've made using pure CSS:
- 🌵 A San Pedro cactus, a plant I <em>desperately</em> want in my personal collection, but don't have the climate for
- 🐱 A cartoon version of my tortoiseshell cat, Buffy
- 🤖 A Gundam head! This is as close as I will ever get to building an actual Gundam
- 🪴 A plant shelf! I <strong>love</strong> plants, both code-based and chlorophyll based :)
